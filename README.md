Welcome to my learning repository! ðŸ“š

Here, I study and practice the following web development technologies:

- **PHP** (a server-side programming language for creating dynamic web applications)  

## Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of web development fundamentals.
- Learn how to build simple web applications using server-side logic and databases.
- Practice integrating client-side and server-side components.

## Content
This repository contains various learning projects, code examples, and notes I create during the learning process.
